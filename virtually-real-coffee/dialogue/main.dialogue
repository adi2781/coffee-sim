System Assistant: Booting Up… 
System Assistant: It’s a nice little day at the local cafe. The weather is sunny, approximately 67 degrees Fahrenheit, 19.4 degrees Celsius. There is a 10% chance of rain, and the humidity is at a comfortable 35%. It’s the perfect day for a nice customer to get their cup of coffee. 
Customer: Good morning. ...
Customer: Ahem..
System Assistant: Oh! That’s the first customer of the day- let’s take their order.  
System Assistant: This is Meri, a regular at this cafe. They usually come in between the times of 6:00-6:15, picking up a concept coffee just before work. Preferred flavor: Post Modern Architecture. Initiate small talk. 
Rachel: Hello there and good morning yourself! Would you like your usual? 
Customer: Yes, please. Thank you. 
System Assistant: Loading Coffee Creation... (Minigame)
System Assistant: Coffee created successfully. Proceed with customer.
Customer: …Actually, could I try something different? 
Rachel: Of course! I apologize for the inconvenience. What would you like? 
Customer: I’m not sure. 
Rachel: Well, we have the perfect option for you!  Mind Writing. With advanced AI technology, I can essentially read the mind of any customer, and come up with the perfect concept coffee flavor.
Customer: Hm…okay, I’ll try it. It doesn’t cost extra, does it? Everything seems to cost extra nowadays, heh. 
Rachel: Since this is your first time using this incredible technology, no, it does not! [Disclaimer: Will Cost Extra For The Next Procedure.] 
Customer: (sighs) Alright, hit me with it. 
System Assistant: Booting up Mind Writing systems. System check. Ready to operate.
Rachel: Has anything concerned you recently? 
Customer: ...Nothing in particular. 
Narrator: But there is something in particular. We can see it, with our perfected eyes. The slight frown, and small furrowing of the brow. She looks withdrawn, slumped. Completely closed off, as if not used to social interaction. What’s wrong with her? 
Rachel: Is it something to do with family?
Customer: Oh! How’d you know? Yeah, kinda... 
Rachel: Your family is not around? Do you miss them?
Customer: Yeah, I guess I do. I’ve been busy, and not had a lot of time for them...and they live far away... 
Rachel: Is there a particular memory you miss with your family?
Customer: I remember when I was a kid, after school and work was over, we would sit in the living room, by the fireplace, watching a movie. 
System Assistant: Loading Coffee Creation... (Minigame)
Rachel: (Done Processing!) Thank you for your cooperation! I will just be a moment! 
System Assistant: Heartwarming Fireplace Scene! The perfect flavor for this customer!
Rachel: Based on your Mind Writing, this flavor should be your perfect match! 
Customer: Takes a sip....They love it! Oh my..! What flavor is this? 
Rachel: Sorry! I cannot say- but when you come in next time for your Mind Writing for the low price of $50.99, you may also learn the name of the flavor for an additional $10!
Customer: (Unimpressed) ...Right. Technology, hm. (looks at nametag) Rachel, right? 
Rachel: That is the name of my program, yes. 
Customer: Thanks. I don’t...really know if you guys can feel, or anything. But you knew I wanted to be with my family again, and tried to make me happy. I appreciate that. Have a nice day. 
System Assistant: The first customer has left!
System Assistant: That is the first time we’ve heard ‘Have a nice day’ from someone. We have studied it before, and it is to be expected, but in recent years, has become more rare. Well, time to get on with the rest of the day!
